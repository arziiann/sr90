Python JSON Parser
The Python JSON Parser is a command-line program that allows the user to read and modify JSON documents. It provides functionalities to add new fields, delete fields, and update existing field values in a JSON file.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Usage
To use the Python JSON Parser, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Save the JSON file you want to modify in the same directory as the parser script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the parser script is located.

Run the script using the command: python json_parser.py

The parser will display the original contents of the JSON file.

Enter commands to modify the JSON file as per the following format:

To add or update a field: key = new_value
To delete a field: del key
To exit the parser: exit
After each modification, the parser will display the updated contents of the JSON file.

Continue entering commands until you are finished. When you are done, you can exit the parser by entering exit.

The final modified JSON data will be saved in the original JSON file.
